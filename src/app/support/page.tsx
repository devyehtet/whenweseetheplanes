          A New Burma is a collective of young people who believe in working together toward a shared goal: building a future inclusive of all who would call Myanmar home. We have unique sets of skillsand experiences in start-ups, marketing, politics, human rights, legal and economic activism, and across the social and creative industries. Many of us are exiled creativesourselves, and through countless conversations with fellow creatives, we understand that life is more than just surviving; shared creativity and generous community help give existence identity and meaning. We believe Creative Resistance goes beyond refusing to be controlled, it is also about envisioning and building the New Free, together.
